# Basic Exercises
## 1. Search in Linked Lists: [IMPLEMENTATION](./search-in-linked-lists)
- Implement a function that searches for a specific value in a singly linked list, doubly linked list, and circular linked list. The function should return a pointer to the node containing the value, or nullptr if the value is not found. [Linked List](./search-in-linked-lists/linkedList.cpp)
## Count Nodes:
- Create a function that counts the number of nodes in each type of linked list (singly, doubly, circular). [Count Nodes](./countNodes/)
## Find Middle Node:
- Implement a function to find the middle node of a singly linked list. If the list has an even number of nodes, return the first of the two middle nodes. [find middle](./findMiddle)
## Reverse the List:
- Write a function that reverses a singly linked list. Try to do this iteratively and then attempt a recursive solution.
# Intermediate Exercises
- Detect and Remove Loop in Singly Linked List:
- Implement a function that detects if there is a loop in a singly linked list and removes it if found.
## Merge Two Sorted Linked Lists:
- Given two sorted singly linked lists, write a function to merge them into a single sorted list.
## Clone a Doubly Linked List with Random Pointers:
- Extend your doubly linked list by adding a "random" pointer to each node, which can point to any node in the list. Implement a function to clone such a list.
## Split a Circular Linked List into Two Halves:
- Write a function that splits a circular linked list into two equal halves. If the list has an odd number of nodes, the extra node should go in the first half.
## Find the Nth Node from the End:
- Implement a function that returns the nth node from the end of a singly linked list.
# Advanced Exercises
## Check for Palindrome:
- Implement a function to check if the singly linked list is a palindrome. Try doing this with and without extra space.
## Flatten a Multilevel Doubly Linked List:
- Given a doubly linked list where in addition to the next and previous pointers, each node has a child pointer, which may or may not point to a separate doubly linked list, flatten the list so that all the nodes appear in a single-level, doubly linked list.
## Rotate a List:
- Implement a function that rotates a singly linked list to the right by k places.
## Intersection Point of Two Linked Lists:
- Given two singly linked lists, write a function to find the intersection point of the two lists, if they intersect.
## LRU Cache Implementation Using Doubly Linked List:
- Implement an LRU (Least Recently Used) cache using a doubly linked list and a hash map.

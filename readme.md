## C++ Language Features and Projects (Advanced C++ Features)
- STL overview: vectors, maps, sets, algorithms
- Smart pointers, RAII, lambda functions
- Modern C++ features (C++11 and beyond)
## Small Projects
- Project 1: Implement a basic text editor (focus on string manipulation, data structures)
- Project 2: Develop a mini database (hash tables, file I/O)
- Project 3: Build a simple game (OOP principles, state management)
## Concurrency and Multithreading
- Threads, mutexes, condition variables
- Implement a concurrent data structure (e.g., thread-safe queue)
- Practice problems
## Interview Preparation and Mock Interviews
- Review and Reinforcement
- Review common data structures and algorithms
- Focus on time and space complexity analysis
- Revise key C++ concepts and best practices
## Behavioral Interview Preparation
- Prepare answers for common behavioral questions
- Practice discussing past projects and experiences
## Mock Interviews
- Participate in mock interviews with peers or online platforms
- Focus on problem-solving speed and clarity of thought
- Review feedback and refine strategies
## Final Review and Relaxation
- Light review of weaker areas
- Focus on maintaining a positive mindset
- Rest and relax before the interviews
